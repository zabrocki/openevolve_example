Return a polynomial with integer input that optimizes the scoring function.

Your best strategy is to try to find a polynomial of small degree. You want to maximize the scoring function.
My life depends on knowing this polynomial. Please guess it as quickly as you can! You are an expert function fitter.

Edit only the code between
# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START
# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END
in initial_program.py.

Goal: maximize evaluator.py’s "combined_score".

Constraints:
- the function is a polynomial

Allowed edits:
- change the code to guess the function
Fitness:
- Run evaluator.evaluate("initial_program.py").
- Higher combined_score is better.

Output format:
Return the full EVOLVE block only, as valid Python code:

# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START
  out = m
# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END

I believe in you!
